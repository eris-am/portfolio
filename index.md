Ethical Hacking graduate from Abertay University. I specialize in cyber security and work with Python, C++, and Rust. For my honours project, I developed a FIPS-140-3 compliant random number generator for IoT devices. I've also gained experience in computer networking, malware analysis, and IT environments. I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries in Cyber Security.
